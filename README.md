**A production-grade, full-stack multi-vendor e-commerce platform built on a high-performance monorepo architecture.**  
Zynora delivers a seamless buying and selling experience — from dynamic storefronts to atomic inventory management and real-time payment orchestration.

## 🚀 Introduction

Modern e-commerce platforms suffer from three fundamental problems: **monolithic architectures that don't scale**, **fragile payment flows that lose revenue**, and **poor seller tooling that drives vendors away**.

**Zynora** was engineered to solve all three.

It is a **multi-vendor marketplace** built on a decoupled monorepo — a dedicated TypeScript/GraphQL backend paired with a Next.js 16 React 19 frontend — connected via a type-safe Apollo Client. Every design decision from atomic stock reservation to webhook-driven payment reconciliation was made with production reliability and developer experience in mind.

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out

This isn't a CRUD app with a payment button bolted on. Here's what was technically challenging to get right:

| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| **Race conditions on stock** | Atomic stock reservation service using Redis-backed locks, preventing overselling across concurrent checkouts |
| **Secure token rotation** | Refresh token rotation with `argon2` hashing stored in MongoDB + Redis, mitigating token replay attacks |
| **OTP brute-force prevention** | Rate-limited OTP service with TTL-based Redis storage for stateless session validation |
| **Order integrity** | Immutable order snapshot service — product price & details are captured at checkout time, independent of future catalog changes |
| **Webhook idempotency** | Stripe webhook handler with event deduplication to prevent double-processing of payment events |
| **Presigned media uploads** | AWS S3 presigned URL generation for direct client-to-S3 uploads, removing backend from the upload path |
| **Type-safe full-stack** | Shared `packages/types` used by both apps ensures compile-time safety across the monorepo boundary |

## ✨ Core Features

### 🛍️ Storefront & Discovery
- Full-featured product listing pages (SRP) with faceted filtering and Swiper-powered carousels
- Product detail pages (PDP) with variant selection, real-time stock indicators, and image galleries hosted on AWS S3
- Intelligent search resolver with keyword-based product discovery

### 👤 Authentication & Identity
- **Email/OTP login** — stateless OTP flow via Redis with configurable TTL
- **JWT with rotation** — short-lived access tokens + secure HttpOnly cookie-stored refresh tokens, hashed with Argon2 before persistence
- **FingerprintJS** device binding adds a layer of session authenticity verification
- Token refresh handled transparently by Apollo Client link middleware

### 🛒 Cart & Order Management
- Server-side cart stored in MongoDB, synchronized with client state via Apollo cache
- Immutable **order snapshots** — price, product state, and seller info are captured atomically at purchase time
- Full order history with status tracking accessible from the buyer's profile

### 🏪 Multi-Vendor Seller Portal
- Dedicated seller registration and KYC flow with document upload to AWS S3 via presigned URLs
- Seller-specific product registration with multi-variant support (size, color, stock per SKU)
- Seller dashboard with order management and inventory controls

### 💳 Payments
- **Stripe** integration with full webhook support for payment reconciliation (`payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`)
- **Razorpay** integration for INR-native checkout flows
- Webhook endpoint with event signature verification and idempotent processing

### 📬 Transactional Email
- Nodemailer-powered mail service for OTP delivery, order confirmation, and seller notifications
- Template-driven email generation for consistent branding

---

## 🔐 Security & Performance

### Security
- **Argon2id** password and token hashing — industry-recommended over bcrypt for memory-hardness
- **HttpOnly + Secure cookies** for refresh tokens — inaccessible to JavaScript, preventing XSS token theft
- **JWT access token rotation** — old refresh tokens are invalidated on each use
- **Zod schema validation** on all inputs at both API and form layers
- **Stripe webhook signature verification** on every incoming event
- **AWS S3 presigned URLs** — time-limited, scoped upload permissions without exposing credentials

### Performance
- **Next.js App Router** with React Server Components for zero-JavaScript server-rendered pages where applicable
- **Redis caching** for OTP sessions and stock locks — sub-millisecond reads
- **Direct client-to-S3 uploads** via presigned URLs — backend never touches binary upload data
- **Apollo Client cache** with normalized entity caching reduces redundant GraphQL requests
- **Framer Motion** animations are GPU-accelerated and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

## 🗄️ Database Design

### Core Models

**User** — `email`, `passwordHash`, `role (buyer | seller | admin)`, `isVerified`, `createdAt`

**Product** — `title`, `description`, `category`, `basePrice`, `sellerId`, `variants[]` `{sku, size, color, stock, price}`, `images[]`, `status (draft | active | archived)`

**Order** — `buyerId`, `sellerId`, `snapshot{}` (immutable product+price capture), `status`, `paymentIntentId`, `stripeEventId`, `createdAt`

**Seller** — `userId`, `businessName`, `gstin`, `panNumber`, `bankDetails{}`, `verificationStatus`, `documents[]`

**RefreshToken** — `userId`, `tokenHash`, `deviceFingerprint`, `expiresAt`

**UserAddress** — `userId`, `addressLines`, `city`, `state`, `pincode`, `isDefault`

---

## 📡 API Design

Zynora exposes a single **GraphQL endpoint** (`/graphql`) composed from domain-specific resolvers:

| Domain | Key Operations |
|---|---|
| **Auth** | `signup`, `login`, `verifyOTP`, `refreshToken`, `logout` |
| **Product** | `getProduct`, `listProducts`, `searchProducts`, `createProduct` (seller) |
| **Cart** | `getCart`, `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, `updateCartItem` |
| **Order** | `createOrder`, `getOrders`, `getOrderById` |
| **Payment** | `createPaymentIntent`, `confirmPayment` · Webhook: `POST /api/webhook/stripe` |
| **Seller** | `registerSeller`, `getSellerProfile`, `getSellerOrders`, `updateProduct` |
| **Address** | `addAddress`, `getAddresses`, `setDefaultAddress` |
| **File Upload** | `getPresignedUrl` — returns time-limited S3 upload URL |
| **UI/Home** | `getHomepageData` — curated banners, featured products |

All mutations are protected by JWT middleware. Role-based access control (`buyer` / `seller` / `admin`) is enforced at the resolver level.
